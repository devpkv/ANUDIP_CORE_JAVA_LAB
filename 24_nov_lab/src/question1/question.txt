The management of LearnMore University is planning to automate the University 
management system. Therefore, Steve Wilkinson, the programmer, has decided to 
create a Java program that accepts the student details, such as the first name, 
last name, age, course enrolled, and student ID. In addition, he also needs to 
accept the employee details, such as first name, last name, age, salary, department 
name, designation, and employee ID. Steve must ensure the reusability of code. The 
program must offer a choice to accept either the student’s or employee’s details. 
Help Steve to develop the program.
